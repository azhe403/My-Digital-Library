## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azhe403/My-Digital-Library.git
cd My-Digital-Library
npm install
npm start
```

## Useful Commands

- `npm start` - starts a dev server and opens browser with running app
- `npm run start:prod` - runs full prod build and serves prod bundle
- `npm run test` - runs lint and tests
- `npm run watch` - runs tests in watch mode
- `npm run prettier` - runs prettier to format whole code base (`.ts` and `.scss`)
- `npm run analyze` - runs full prod build and `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to visualize how much code is shipped (dependencies & application)

## Make It Your Own

When using this starter project to build your own app you might consider some of the following steps:

- use `search and replace` functionality of your favourite IDE to replace `anms` with `<your-app-prefix>`
- rename project in `package.json` `name` property and set appropriate version (eg `0.0.0` or `1.0.0`)
- rename app in `/environments/` files (will be shown in browser tab)
- delete pre-existing `CHANGELOG.md` (you will generate your own with future releases of your features)
- delete `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `BUILT_WITH.md` files as they are relevant only if project is open sourced on Github
- edit the title and Open Graph metadata properties in `index.html`
- remove or adjust links in the [footer](https://github.com/Azhe403/My-Digital-Library/blob/master/src/app/app.component.html#L79)
- replace logo in `/assets` folder ( currently 128 x 128 pixel `png` file )
- adjust colors in `/themes/default-theme.scss`
- create a pull request in the [original repository](https://github.com/Azhe403/My-Digital-Library/) to update `BUILT_WITH.md` [file](https://github.com/Azhe403/My-Digital-Library/blob/master/BUILT_WITH.md) with a link and short description of your project

#### Continuous Integration

Starter project is using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for running linters and tests on every commit.
Based on your preferences and needs you can either:

- not use / use other CI server and delete both `.travis.yml` and `.travis-deploy.sh`
- create Travis CI account and link it to your projects Github repo and [configure build](https://medium.com/@tomastrajan/continuous-deployment-of-client-side-apps-with-github-pages-travis-ci-10e9d641a889)
  with `GH_REF` and `GH_TOKEN` environment variables for automatic deployment of releases to Github Pages

## Goals

The main goal of this repository is to provide an up to date example of Angular application following all recent best practices in various areas like:

- `@ngrx/store` - including reducers, actions, selectors
- `@ngrx/effects` - for implementation of side effects like `http` requests, logging, notifications,...
- `@ngrx/entity` - for CRUD operations
- `@ngrx/router-store` - to connect the Angular Router to @ngrx/store
- `@ngrx/store-devtools` - to enable a powerful time-travelling debugger.
- `@angular/material` - material design component library, theming, ...
- routing
- testing of all the above mentioned concepts
- Angular CLI configuration (prod build, budgets, ...)

This repository will also strive to always stay in sync with releases of Angular and the related libraries.
The nature of the repository is also a great match for first time open source contributors who can add
simple features and enhance test coverage, all contributors are more than welcome!

## Features

- custom themes support (4 themes included)
- lazy-loading of feature modules
- lazy reducers
- localStorage ui state persistence
- `@ngrx/effects` for API requests

- Angular Material
- Bootstrap 4 (only reset, utils and grids)

## Troubleshooting

- **Blocking at emitting LicenseWebpackPlugin when npm start** - try using [cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm) instead of npm
